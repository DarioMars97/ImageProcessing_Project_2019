## Idea :
The user takes or upload  a picture of a bus number then the application shows him the path of that bus on google maps
    

## Method used 
OpenCV KNN charachter recognition to recognize the arabic numbers
We took this [repo](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersAndMore/OpenCV_3_KNN_Character_Recognition_Python) as a reference and modified a little to recognize arabic numbers.
An android [app](https://github.com/MuhammedSabry/Bus-Route.git) to take and upload the picture

## How it works
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tStfsfmlP_U&feature=youtu.be) shows how the app works
